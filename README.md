# Computational Models of Music Perception 

This respository contains materials for a one hour lecture on the topic of computational models of music perception and cognition.
The level of the course is aimed at upper level undergraduate and graduate students.

By the end of the lecture, the students should be able to:

1. Explain the difference between descriptive, predictive, and explanatory models of music perception.
2. Describe how a computational model of music perception is tested
3. Use Guest and Martin taxonomy to provide critical commentary on models they read about in the literature 



## Outline 

- What is a model?
    + Formalisation of the world that says what should happen when under specific conditions
    + Example from physics => Speed of object when it is thrown off building 
    + Leaning tower of Pisa 
    + Benefits: very specific, very easy to scrutinise 
        + Ask: 
    + Drawbacks: Very specific, very easy to scrutennise 
        + Ask: What is missing in this model?
        + Ask: How can it be proven wrong? 
        + Define: Falsifiablity?
- How do we arrive at a model?
    + Discover idea: Cosmology A 
        + There are laws of the universe, it is up to use humans to figure them out
    + Learn idea: Cosmology B 
        + There is data in the world, it is us to us humans to describe the world via reductions
    + ASK: What is one benefit and con for each way of thinking about the world?
    + ASK: What would this mean in our physics example? 
        + Drop lots of balls from buildings at various heights? 
        + Come up with law, test it against data
        + need both MODEL and DATA
        + What does it mean for a model to be good?
- What are the equivlient models of music perception?
    + ASK: What is set of musical behaviors where we could provide similar guesss of what happens under what conditions?
    + Borrow from PH 
    + Emotions, Memory for Melodies , Timbre perception, Entraiment, Limits of Human Hearing, Expectancy Responses in Brain 
- Case Studies
    + Harmony: Consonance, dissonance, learned 
    + Expectation: IDyOM and Temperly 
    + Memory: Baker?
