# Computational Models of Music Perception 

This repository contains materials for a one hour lecture on the topic of computational models of music perception and cognition.
The level of the course is aimed at upper level undergraduate and graduate students.

* [Link to Repository Pages](https://davidjohnbaker1.github.io/computational_models_of_music_perception_lecture/)

By the end of the lecture, the students should be able to:

1. Explain the difference between descriptive, predictive, and explanatory models of music perception.
2. Describe how a computational model of music perception is tested
3. Use Guest and Martin taxonomy to provide critical commentary on models they read about in the literature 


## Outline 

- What is a model?
    + Formalisation of the world that says what should happen when under specific conditions
    + Example from physics => Speed of object when it is thrown off building 
    + Leaning tower of Pisa 
    + Benefits: very specific, very easy to scrutinise 
        + Ask: 
    + Drawbacks: Very specific, very easy to scrutennise 
        + Ask: What is missing in this model?
        + Ask: How can it be proven wrong? 
        + Define: Falsifiablity?
- How do we arrive at a model?
    + Discover idea: Cosmology A 
        + There are laws of the universe, it is up to use humans to figure them out
    + Learn idea: Cosmology B 
        + There is data in the world, it is us to us humans to describe the world via reductions
    + ASK: What is one benefit and con for each way of thinking about the world?
    + ASK: What would this mean in our physics example? 
        + Drop lots of balls from buildings at various heights? 
        + Come up with law, test it against data
        + need both MODEL and DATA
        + What does it mean for a model to be good?
- What are the equivlient models of music perception?
    + ASK: What is set of musical behaviors where we could provide similar guesss of what happens under what conditions?
    + Borrow from PH 
    + Emotions, Memory for Melodies , Timbre perception, Entraiment, Limits of Human Hearing, Expectancy Responses in Brain 
- Case Studies
    + Harmony: Consonance, dissonance, learned 
    + Expectation: IDyOM and Temperly 
    + Memory: Baker?

### Further 




## Scratch

- Today talking about world of computational models of music perception and cognition
- If coming from a music background, need to make sure were on the same page 
- unlike temperly quote 


- Lively area and community of people who are interested in it
- getting in is always difficult
- so going to give you my version 

- First task is to get on board with terms
- computational model 
- let's start first with model
- what is it, why do we need it? 
- well, need to start higher up 

- As scientists, (not data scientists or engineers) one of our goals is to explain why things happen

- As scientists, we want to know about how the universe works.
- And one way we judge how good we are at this is through our ability to describe, predict, and explain. 

Pisa Example
  + Formalisation of model 
  + use to transition to model of music perception and cognition 
  + Ask question: What types of problems are best suited for computational models? 
  + Rank order 

Meterologist Example
  + Severity of Prediction 
  
Use GUEST framework
  
Steps to Process:
  + Formalise via Computation 
  + Extract author from thoughts
  + Your thoughts run on someone else's computer 
  + Compare predictions of your theory to empirical data
  + Learn from match/mismatch of theory + data 
  
Have both subjective and objective 

Case Study: Consonance  (10 Minutes/ 1 Slide per Minute )
  + Taken from Harrison and Pearce (2020)
  1. Consonance => Subjective rating of pleasantness 
    + examples with interface 
  2. Roughness
  3. Harmonicity 
  4. Learned 
  5. Input(Chord) => Score (show R)
  6. Figures  
  7. So What? 
  
Case Study 2: Rhythm  (10 Minutes)

Case Study 3: Melodic Expectation (10 Minutes)
  + Meyer 
  + Narmour 
  + Margulis 
  + Pearce 
  + Temperly 
  
  + Baker on Memory 


  

  

- Quintessential example of our able to predict what happens comes from dropping bowling balls.
-

- For example, take meteorologist.
- Their job is to be able to predict the weather.

-------------------

- for example, law of gravity 



So in that spirit, lets stop to think about how this might be applied not in physics, but in music perception and cognition.

Think pair share: turn to a friend and come up with as many different questions of music perception and cognition that you could computational model. OK to use the readings, most wins. You have three minutes. 

Count, see who has most, go through

Great, should have list that might include things like..

- LIST HERE




Reviewing
https://pmcharrison.github.io/intro-to-music-and-science/computational-music-psychology.html

Now going to go through a few case study examples where talk through some examples from the  literature

- Harmony 
- Expectancy 
- Memory 
- Key Finding Algorithms 
- Performance 

Now when do this, going to see many parallels to other parts of science
We don't just end up always getting a perfect solution, sometimes impossible
And with complex phenomena, not always going to be one or the other.

But what this does is allows us to compare theories
so just like baddely vs cowan or origins.

Borrow from reading from Guest and Martin to adopt specific terms 

* Picture here from their paper 

Other side:

- formalize in terms of computational model (your thoughts on other's computer)
- write out a computer program to make it so your thoughts run on someone else's computer
- collect data
- compare your model predictions with data
- think, discuss, iterate 

{Case Studies}

Other Applications

Have described many cognitive models here (since this is a cognitive class)
Also mention that this format very simlar to the whole MIR/MIRex thing.

Interestingly this global benchmarking of models does not exist with cognitive people.
