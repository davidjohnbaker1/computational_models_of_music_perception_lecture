# Computational Models of Music Perception 

This repository contains materials for an 3 part lecture on the topic of computational models of music perception and cognition.
The lectures are broken down into the following sections that can be put together given the level of the students:

* What are computational models of music? Why do we need them? (45 minutes, undergrad)
* Hands on Activity (30 minutes)
* History of computational models of music perception (45 minutes, graduate)

The level of the course is aimed at upper level undergraduate and graduate students.

* [Link to Slow Talk Through the Deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNX6W_B_lE)

By the end of the lecture, the students should be able to answer:

1. Why would a music perception researcher want to use a computational model in their own program of research?
2. What is the difference between a statistical and computational model?
3. Can you list an example of an assumption that a modeler might need to make in order to create a computational model of music perception?
4. What are some problems that concern ground truth and musical data?
5. What are three examples of questions that have been investigated with computational models in music perception?

### What Are Computational Models of Music Perception and Why Do We Need Them?

The opening section is either meant to be a slow introduction to computational models for undergraduate students who have not been exposed to this type of research before or a quicker introduction for graduate students who have some degree of familarity with this. 

The lesson assumes at least **some** of the students in the class have either music literacy (not all) and a general interest in music perception and cognition. 

The main purpose of the **Computational Model** slides is to introduce idea that

1. Computation is a much more general term than most people think (people can be computers)
2. Models are not the real world, nor can they be

After a brief discussion of making sure everyone is on shared language, we move to thinking about why we might want to make models. 

The point to make sure is clearly understood is that models allow for ideas to stand independelty, formalized, and ready to be critiqued by others.

Before going deeper, an example is provided where a model might predict easy or hard melodies.
The purpose of this is to make clear that a model follows **input output** format. 
This leads to a discussion of **ground truth** and what is meant by that in this context. 

After giving this difficulty of melody example, we then address several new terms

* Statistical Model
* Computational Model 

A check for understanding/synthesis of materials is done with a Think, Pair, Share with Wiggins 2007 quote on the deck. 

If time permits, a plenary activity asking students to use all terms to discuss a possible research question in music perception allows for a final check for understanding before the break. 

### Activity: Key Finding with Melody

The group activity is introduced second to break more heavy, technical discussion. 

Students are tasked with creating their own key finding algorithm for melodies.
A brief primer is given of what is meant by key in this context (Name + Mode).
Text here was written assuming students have near mimimal understanding of music notation. 
Audio examples are provided for each excerpt. 

The task is explained with an example of how this might work.

> ALERT! I have not tried this in practice yet and do not know if the instructions are clear enough or the task is too complicated

Structure the time to be 

* Ten minutes to work on coming up with an algoritm 
* Ten minues to share 
* Time to assess each model with a test melody 

Several plenary review questions are given to capture some higher level points that will hopefully emerge from the task. 

### Survey and Review of Literature 

The survey and review of literature attempts to give a high level, case study inspired understanding of this area of research. 
The first several slides review the history of this type of research. 

Then three case studies are presented looking at 

* Consonance and Dissonance
* IDyOM + Meyer 
* Beat Induction

These three topic areas were chosen due to my familiarity with the programs of research.

**BOLDED** papers are explicitly referenced in the lecture slides. 

* [ ] TODO: ADD Beat Perception Papers after adding to deck 

A final plenary/learning goals check is at the end of the lesson.
