## Predicting What Happens

::: {.incremental .column width="65%"}
If I were to stand on top of the [Leaning Tower of Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa) and [drop both a bowling ball and a marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment) from the top at the same time...

* What would happen? 
* What assumptions would have to be true for that to happen?
* How do we know?

:::{.notes}
If youâ€™re not familiar with the story, supposedly between 1589 and 1592, Galileo Galilei is said to have dropped two spheres of different mass from a top the Leaning Tower of Pisa in order to demonstrate that all objects fall with the same acceleration.
